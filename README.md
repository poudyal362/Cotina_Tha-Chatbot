# Cotina_Tha-Chatbot
Cotina is a smart chatbot developed using ML and NLP on Python. You can train her by contributing to her library. She is developed using voice recognition and you can directly interact with her with your voice command.
I have presented the code in simple format without any classes/modules/interfaces. The bot is trained using random forest classifier with accuracy score of around 90%. The training data set is QSC.csv. The classified classifies the input statement as salutation and question for which there are two different libraries CQ.csv and QQ.csv. The corresponding responses are saved in CA.csv and QA. csv respectively.
She requires pyaudio for speech recognication, pandas to load the library on data frame, sklearn for machine learing, nltk for NLP
I have upladed the detail workflow in COTINA.pdf.
Happy coding everyone!!!
