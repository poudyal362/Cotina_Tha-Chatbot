41,"Admission is created in MEG based on few input parameters. Like, the claims should contain Facilty and Professional BillTypes and only Inpatient facilty Room & Board Claims are used to build admissions. Hence, BillType field should contain values - F (Facilty) and P (Professional). And claims contributing to billtype 'P' or 'F' should have 'Room & Board' claims.",
42,"Besides proper values in BillType i.e 'F' & 'P', Revcode should be well populated in CO_CLAIMS_IWC table. Revcode should contain 'R' before each code i.e R100. Failing to do so will fail the join condition between co_claims_iwc and co_d2params. CO_D2PARAMS contains revcodes to identify Room & Board Claims and consists of code with 'R' appended in it.",
